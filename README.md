# text-editor

## Description
This week (PWA's) we needed to repair/continue working on a Text Editor. It is expected that this Text Editor runs in the browser, just a single page application that meets PWA criteria.
Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.
